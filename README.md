On February 29th, 2024, CISA released an advisory on Phobos ransomware. Phobos is a type of ransomware that primarily targets small to medium-sized businesses by encrypting their files and demanding a ransom for decryption. It is known for its use of various distribution methods, including RDP brute force attacks and email phishing.
The project entails performing both basic and advanced static and dynamic analyses of the Phobos ransomware. The objective is to identify host-based indicators, including file system or registry alterations, as well as network-based indicators, such as command and control server communications, to assist in detecting and mitigating this threat.
